# Aviation Heaven ‚úàÔ∏è

A beautiful 3D aviation experience built with React Three Fiber, featuring a detailed airplane model soaring through animated clouds with a stunning sky environment.

## Features

- **3D Airplane Model**: Detailed airplane built with Three.js geometries including body, wings, tail, windows, and propeller
- **Animated Clouds**: Multiple cloud formations with different sizes, opacities, and movement patterns
- **Dynamic Sky**: Beautiful sky environment with sunset lighting
- **Smooth Animations**: Gentle floating airplane animation and slow cloud movement
- **Interactive Controls**: Orbit controls for camera movement and exploration
- **Responsive Design**: Works beautifully on desktop and mobile devices
- **Modern UI**: Elegant overlay with glowing text effects

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Airplane.tsx    # 3D airplane model with animations
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Clouds.tsx      # Cloud formations and movement
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ App.tsx             # Main application component
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ App.css             # Application styles
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.css           # Global styles
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ main.tsx           # Application entry point
```

## Controls

- **Mouse/Touch**: Click and drag to rotate the camera around the scene
- **Scroll**: Zoom in and out
- **Pan**: Right-click and drag to pan the view

## Customization

### Modifying the Airplane

The airplane model is built in `src/components/Airplane.tsx` using basic Three.js geometries. You can:

- Change colors by modifying the `color` prop in materials
- Adjust size by changing geometry `args`
- Modify animation by editing the `useFrame` hook

### Adjusting Clouds

Cloud properties can be modified in `src/components/Clouds.tsx`:

- `opacity`: Cloud transparency (0-1)
- `speed`: Animation speed
- `width/depth`: Cloud dimensions
- `segments`: Detail level
- `position`: Location in 3D space
- `scale`: Size multiplier

### Sky Environment

The sky environment is configured in `src/App.tsx`:

- `Sky` component controls the sky appearance
- `Environment` provides lighting presets
- `ambientLight` and `directionalLight` control scene lighting
